ldesc: "Postler is a lean mail interface. Messages are read from Maildir 
folders, HTML is rendered, composed and spell-checked with WebKitGTK+. 
The application consists of independent modules, the reader, viewer and 
the composer. Each module runs separately. No network access occurs from 
within the user interface by default, offline access is integral."
